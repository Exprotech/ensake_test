# Ensake Frontend Test

This repository contains two projects as part of the Ensake Frontend Test:

1. **Showdown**
2. **Wheel**

## Showdown

### Overview

The Showdown project is designed to test animation skills. It utilizes a canvas-based animation that starts on page load and includes a flickering lightning bolt at a 10-second interval.

### Implementation

- The animation is implemented using the [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API).
- You can choose a canvas library of your choice (e.g., Pixi.js, Three.js) for rendering.

### Getting Started

To run the Showdown project:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `showdown/index.html` file in a modern web browser.

## Wheel

### Overview

The Wheel project is meant to test the general understanding of frontend-backend communications. It simulates a wheel of fortune game, allowing users to spin the wheel and receiving a result from a backend endpoint.

### Implementation

- The frontend communicates with a backend endpoint (you can use a static JSON file for testing purposes).
- The wheel spins based on the POSITION value returned from the backend.

### Getting Started

To run the Wheel project:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `wheel/index.html` file in a modern web browser.

- iPhone 7 and newer
- Desktop Chrome (latest)
- Mac Safari (latest)
- Windows IE (10 and newer)

## Responsive Design

Both projects are designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.

## Bonus Features
